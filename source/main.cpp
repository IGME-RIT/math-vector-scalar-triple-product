// The bread and butter of games programming is vector mathematics and linear algebra.
// The vast majority of the mathematics used in games falls under this category,
//  though it is not the only math used (e.g. discrete math, calculus).
// This tutorial series will take you through the basics of vector math.
// Future tutorials in this series will detail other aspects of linear algebra, particularly matrices.
// The exposition follows that of "Foundations of Game Engine Development" (Volume 1),
//  by Eric Lengyel.
// This file provides exposition, definitions, and explanations, and all other files implement vector classes
//  as you would see them in most game engines. The implementations are modeled after those of Eric Lengyel
//  in FGED, Volume 1 and the Tombstone Engine, though they are my own.
// Only Vector2D.h is heavily annotated, the others are mostly identical.

// This tutorial explains the scalar triple product.
// It is not necessary, but is still useful to know.

	// Scalar Triple Product
	// ---------------------
	{
		// The scalar triple product is an odd one out, but it is useful.
		// It relies on the cross product, and so is only defined when the cross product is defined, which for our purposes is only in 3D.

		// Denoted [a, b, c], it is equal to Dot(Cross(a, b), c) = Dot(Cross(b, c), a) = Dot(Cross(c, a), b)
		// The three are equal, as can be shown by expansion.
		// Hence [a, b, c] = [b, c, a] = [c, a, b]
		// Say instead we have [c, b, a].
		// Then [c, b, a] = Dot(Cross(c, b), a) = Dot(Cross(b, a), c) = Dot(-Cross(a, b), c) = -[a, b, c].
		// Hence the scalar triple product has a kind of anticommutativity, in that even permutations are equal but odd permutations are negated.

		// To see how it is equal to the (signed) volume of the parellelepiped with sides a, b, and c, consider the following:
		// For brevity, let a*b := Cross(a, b), a.b := Dot(a, b), and |a| := Magnitude(a)
		// Then [a, b, c] = (a*b).c = |a*b||c|cos(theta). From before, we know that |a*b| is the area of the parallelogram spanned by a and b.
		// Since theta is the angle between a*b and c, there exists a complementary angle phi between c and the parallelogram spanned by a and b.
		// Then the height of the parallelepiped is equal to |c|sin(phi). Since phi and theta are complementary, sin(phi) = cos(theta).
		// Hence [a, b, c] = |a*b||c|sin(phi), which is equal to the area of the base of the parallelepiped times its height.
		// Therefore [a, b, c] is the volume of the parallelepiped.

		Vector3D a(1, 0, 0);
		Vector3D b(0, 1, 0);
		Vector3D c(0, 0, 1);

		if (ScalarTriple(a, b, c) == 1.0f)
		{
			std::cout << "The volume of the unit cube is 1.\n";
		}

		// Note that a property of parallelepipeds is that the angle doesn't matter, if the height remains the same, so does the volume.
		// So c can have any x and y values we want, but so long as it has a z value of 1, the volume will still be 1.
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		{
			c = Vector3D(randFloat(-10, 10), randFloat(-10, 10), 1);
			if (ScalarTriple(a, b, c) - 1.0f < FLT_EPSILON)
			{
				std::cout << "c = " << c << ", yet volume is still 1.\n";
			}
		}

		// In particular, the all vectors c such that comp_(a*b)(c) is constant all define equal-volume parallelepipeds.
		// For example:
		a = Vector3D(randFloat(-1, 1), randFloat(-1, 1), randFloat(-1, 1));
		b = Vector3D(randFloat(-1, 1), randFloat(-1, 1), randFloat(-1, 1));
		c = Vector3D(randFloat(-1, 1), randFloat(-1, 1), randFloat(-1, 1));
		// a, b, and c are now arbitrary vectors.
		Vector3D aCrossb = Cross(a, b);
		float volume = Dot(aCrossb, c);
		std::cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << ", and c = " << c
			<< "\n giving Cross(a, b) = " << aCrossb << " and volume = " << volume << "\n";

		Vector3D cprime;
		// Now, a and b form basis vectors for the plane from which we can select any c and retain constant volume!
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		{
			cprime = c + randFloat(-1, 1) * a + randFloat(-1, 1) * b;
			if (ScalarTriple(a, b, cprime) - volume < FLT_EPSILON)
			{
				std::cout << "cprime = " << cprime << ", yet volume is still " << volume << ".\n";
			}
		}
	}

	// As a post-script, two notes:
	// 1) If you ever do graphics and calculate Dot(n, L), you are actually taking a scalar triple product!
	// 2) Although this formulation relies on the cross product,
	//    there are alternate algebraic systems in which this idea of volumes of parallelepipeds can be extended to any dimension.
	//    However, such systems will not be introduced for some time.
